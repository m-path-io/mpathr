## Overview

The goal of `mpathr` is to provide with a few utility functions to read and perform some common operations in data from Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) studies collected through the 'm-Path' platform (<https://m-path.io/landing/>). The package provides functions to read data from 'm-Path', and to calculate response rate in data from Experience Sampling studies. 

## Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mpathr")
library(mpathr)
```

```{r loading, include = FALSE}
library(mpathr)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to read data gathered from m-Path
into R using the `mpathr` package. For this, we use the example data included 
in the package:

```{r example}
# loads package
library(mpathr)

# find paths to example basic and meta data:
basic_path <- mpath_example(file ='example_basic.csv')
meta_path <- mpath_example(file = 'example_meta.csv')

# read the data
data <- read_mpath(
  file = basic_path,
  meta_data = meta_path
)

print(data)
```

## Getting help
If you encounter a clear bug or need help getting a function to run, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible example on [Github](https://github.com/m-path-io/mpathr/issues).
