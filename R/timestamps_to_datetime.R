#' Convert m-Path timestamps to a date time format
#'
#' @description `r lifecycle::badge("stable")`
#'
#'   m-Path timestamps are based on the participant's local time zone, and when converted to R
#'   datetime format, they may display as UTC. This function allows for the conversion of m-Path
#'   timestamps to datetime, and optionally allows for the specification of a UTC offset or a forced
#'   time zone.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Timestamps in m-Path, like those in `timeStampScheduled` and `timeStampStart`, are a variation on
#' UNIX timestamps, defined as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00. However,
#' unlike standard UNIX timestamps (which use UTC), m-Path timestamps are based on the participant's
#' local time zone. When converted to `R` datetime format, they may display as UTC, which could lead
#' to confusion. This typically isn't an issue when analyzing ESM data within the participant's
#' local context, but it can affect comparisons with other data sources. For accurate
#' cross-referencing with other data, consider specifying the UTC offset to correctly adjust for the
#' participantâ€™s local time. Alternatively, you can force the timestamps to display in a specific
#' time zone using the `force_tz` argument.
#'
#'
#' @param x A vector of timestamps to be transformed to datetime.
#' @param tz_offset A numeric value to be added to the timestamps before transforming to datetime.
#'   This is typically derived from the `timeZoneOffset` column from m-Path data. This is only
#'   useful when you want to compare timestamps in an absolute manner or link it to external data
#'   sources.
#' @param force_tz A string specifying the time zone to force the timestamps to. This is useful when
#'   the data is to be compared to other data sources that are in a different time zone. Note that
#'   this will not change the actual time of the timestamp, but only the time zone that is
#'   displayed. The `lubridate` package is required to be installed for this argument to work.
#'
#' @return A vector of `POSIXct` objects representing the timestamps in the UTC time zone. The time
#'   zone may differ if `force_tz` is specified.

#' # The most common use case for this function: Convert
