Description: Provides tools for importing and cleaning Experience Sampling
    Method (ESM) data collected via the 'm-Path' platform. The goal is
    to provide with a few utility functions to be able to read and perform
    some common operations in ESM data collected through the 'm-Path'
    platform (<https://m-path.io/landing/>). Functions include raw data
    handling, format standardization, and basic data checks, as well as to
    calculate the response rate in data from ESM studies.
