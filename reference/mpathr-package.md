# mpathr: Easily Handling Data from the ‘m-Path’ Platform

Provides tools for importing and cleaning Experience Sampling Method
(ESM) data collected via the 'm-Path' platform. The goal is to provide
with a few utility functions to be able to read and perform some common
operations in ESM data collected through the 'm-Path' platform
(<https://m-path.io/landing/>). Functions include raw data handling,
format standardization, and basic data checks, as well as to calculate
the response rate in data from ESM studies.
